Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   578 out of  14,720    3%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,894
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            82 out of   1,894    4%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 830 out of   1,894   43%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         982 out of   1,894   51%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             102 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
